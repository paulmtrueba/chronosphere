# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Synopsis
After completing work I'm wondering if it might have been a better idea to just leave this project as JS.
I have an understanding of Typescript and have built a couple storybook elements and my current company's code test using it but I feel like I'd have a lot better understanding of how everything was setup if it was all
left in JS rather than having to reference quite a bit of Stackoverflow to correct Typescript errors. I, sadly, had to leave in several expect-error comments.

I also chose to use jest/enzyme for testing as that is what I have been most comfortable with. I have done a lot of research into the jest react-testing-library and know that it can handle all of the cases that I ended
up having to write up spyOn calls for (changing state in functional components or setting a ref) but for the sake of time I used testing that I had worked with in the past.

I decided against including formik because the form required didn't need that much complication but included moment and lodash for the convenience of the included methods.

I tried to build out some yaml that could grab a Github secret containing a personal access token but didn't have much luck so you will have to paste a token into the .env file as the value for the REACT_APP_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN env variable

The project was built and runs with:
node: v14.17.3
npm: 6.14.13
